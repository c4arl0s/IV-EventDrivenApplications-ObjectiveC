IV-EventDrivenApplications-ObjectiveC

- Your applications will have a GUI (graphical user interface), and they will be event-driven.

- An event-Driven Application launches and then starts a run loop which waits for events. When an event happens, the application leaps into action, executing methods, sending messages, etc.
- The run loop waits for events. The waiting application then responds to events generated by the user (like a button tap) or the system (like a low- memory warning).
